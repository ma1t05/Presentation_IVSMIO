  \begin{itemize}
  \item Two different models (Model A and Model B) for the car wreck adjusters location have been proposed. 
    The models can be seen as linear approximations to the SQpM.
  \item We observed that the Model A presents more difficulties for solving small instances.
  \item For small enough values of $\ell$, Model B can be solved relatively quick
    for instances of medium size
  \item The solutions obtained from the Model B for small values of $\ell$
    approximates well the solutions of Model A,
    as well as self solutions for large values of $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
